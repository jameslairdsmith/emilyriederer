I love statistics, data science, open source, and especially [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats). 

Currently, I work as an Analytics Manager at Capital One. My team focuses on reimagining our analytical infrastructure by building data products (e.g. R packages and Shiny applications), elevating business analysis with novel data sources and statistical methods, and providing consultation and training to our partner teams.

Previously, I earned degrees in Mathematics and Mathematical Decision Sciences (Stats / OR) at UNC Chapel Hill. At Carolina, I was a research assistant in the Department of Statistics & Operations Research and focused on testing the impact of Emergency Department patient flow strategies using discrete event simulation.

When I'm not crunching numbers, I enjoy reading, weightlifting, and watching college basketball (Go Tar Heels!)
