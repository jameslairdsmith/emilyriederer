In January, I was honored and excited to receive an invitation from Maelle Salmon to review the [`tradestatistics`](https://ropensci.github.io/tradestatistics/) package for [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/).

## Closing Thoughts

As a few disjointed points of emphasis:

1. I said relatively little about the package itself. [`tradestatistics`](https://ropensci.github.io/tradestatistics/) is an awesome package thanks to the hard work of its author [Mauricio Vargas](https://twitter.com/pachamaltese) who also maintains the API which the R package wraps. Definitely check it out!
2. I also refrained from waxing poetic about [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) (until now) but encourage everyone to learn more about this organization. I am perpetually fasinated by how rOpenSci operates. By setting up a good, modularized process, they are able to virtually corral a massive army of volunteers to help build, curate, and maintain a fabulous set of quality packages.
