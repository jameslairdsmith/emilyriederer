<p>Last winter, I attended a holiday party at a “paint-and-sip” venue. For those unfamiliar, “paint-and-sip” is a semi-trendy cottage industry offering boutique events of music, wine, and a guided painting activity. For example, my group painted sasquatch on a snowy winter’s eve:</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">A very bad painting of a sasquatch in a forest</p>
</div>
<p>As often happens, this completely unrelated thing got me thinking about R. What was it that made coming together fun when we lacked the talent and experience to do well, when it almost surely wouldn’t turn out very well, and when “failure” would be very visible and undeniable? Many of these same dimensions (novelty, risk, and visibility) often seem to inhibit new coders, but somehow they were core to the value proposition of the paint-and-sip business.</p>
<p>(Admittedly, the “sipping” part may be a major confounder here, but this isn’t a post on causal inference!)</p>
<p>Of course, this was nothing more than a tongue-in-cheek thought experiment, but it did bring a few observations to the front of my mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The evening was highly structured</strong>. It would be miserable (at least, for me) to be given any sort of picture and to simply be told to paint it.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Instead, the instructor told us and showed us step-by-step which order to tackle the painting in.</li>
<li><strong>The objective wasn’t too serious</strong>. Complete and utter failure was low stakes. No balls would be dropped. No meetings would be postponed. No deadlines would pass by. There was no dire consequence of trying to paint a sasquatch.</li>
<li><strong>The ability to succeed wasn’t correlated with anything important</strong>. Hopefully, no one is going to measure their self-worth by sasquatch painting. In contrast, sometimes people seem to associate technical skills and abilities as more of a measure of their worth or intelligence. This increses the cost of “failure” and disuades exploration.</li>
<li><strong>The playing field was mostly level</strong>. As far as I know, there are no experts in acryllic sasquatch painting.</li>
</ul>
<p>It did pique my curiosity if these principles could help introduce concepts like GitHub or package development in a friendlier and more engaging way. Over the next few mnths, life carried on and took me in a variety of directions, including to the Chicago R unconf where I marvelled at the passion and productivity of teams coming together for a two day hackathon. Somewhere in there, a project idea began to form.</p>
<div id="introducing-rtistic" class="section level2">
<h2>Introducing <code>Rtistic</code></h2>
<p>Now that you’ve indulged my musings, let me introduce my <a href="https://github.com/emilyriederer/Rtistic"><code>Rtistic</code></a> repo on GitHub.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/rtistic-files/logo.png" alt="Rtistic hex logo" />
<p class="caption">Rtistic hex logo</p>
</div>
<p>Structurally, <code>Rtistic</code> is a package in the sense that you could install it with <code>devtools::install_github()</code>. However, it is not an R package in the sense that you would be sorely disappointed if you did that. <code>Rtistic</code> is incomplete, by intent, and always will be. It is a skeleton of an R package and intended to be used as a “hackathon-in-a-box”. Small groups at a meetup, office, or classroom can come together and collectively build out a package containing palettes and themes for <code>ggplot2</code> and RMarkdown. Much like the paint-and-sip, it strives to be highly structured and low stakes.</p>
<div id="structure" class="section level3">
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>Much of the boilerplate code already exists, so partipants are less likely to get caught up on some cryptic error message. Off-the-shelf, the project’s file structure looks like what’s shown below. Files prefixed with <code>my-</code> are open to edits by each team.</p>
<pre class="text"><code>-- DESCRIPTION

</div>
<div id="whimsical" class="section level3">
<h3>Whimsical…</h3>
<p>With this much structure, participants can focus on the fun task of picking colors, fonts, and other theme components. Truly, a team contribution could be as minimal as defining four palettes in a file similar to the provided <a href="https://github.com/emilyriederer/Rtistic/blob/master/R/my-gg-palette.R"><code>my-gg-palette.R</code> file</a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>test_pal &lt;- c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;red&quot;) # discrete colors
test_pal_op &lt;- c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;grey50&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)        # discrete colors mapping to good/neutral/bad
test_pal_cont &lt;- c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;)             # endpoints for a continous scale
test_pal_div &lt;- c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;red&quot;)       # reference points for diverging scale</code></pre>
<p>These palettes can then be used in a number of functions (thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/emilyriederer/Rtistic/blob/master/R/palette-infrastructure.R"><code>R/palette-infrastructure.R</code> file</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>scale_(color/colour/fill)_discrete_rtistic(palette = &quot;test&quot;)</code>: Discrete palette with optional <code>extend</code> parameter to interpolate more values</li>
<li><code>scale_(color/colour/fill)_opinionated_rtistic(palette = &quot;test&quot;)</code>: Discrete palette to map to subjectively coded “good”/“bad”/“neutral” column</li>
<li><code>scale_(color/colour/fill)_continuous_rtistic(palette = &quot;test&quot;)</code>: Standard continous palette</li>
<li><code>scale_(color/colour/fill)_diverging_rtistic(palette = &quot;test&quot;)</code>: Diverging continuous palette</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, that contribution leads to the following styles:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-25-rtistic-a-package-by-numbers-repo.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>To “level up”, participants can also use <code>roxygen2</code> syntax to add documentation about their theme and showcase it by editing the <a href="https://github.com/emilyriederer/Rtistic/blob/master/scratchpad/gg-theme-demo.Rmd"><code>my-gg-theme-vignette.Rmd</code> template</a>. Adding actual <code>ggplot2</code> and RMarkdown themes is slightly more advanced, but the core design of participants altering templates still holds.</p>
<p>You can try all this out for yourself on <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/project/363105">RStudio Cloud</a>. Simply resave the <code>my-gg-palette.R</code> file, define new palette colors (named <code>{xxx}_{pal/pal_op/pal_cont/pal_div}</code>), rebuild the package, open the <code>vignettes/my-gg-theme-vignette.Rmd</code> file, change <code>palette = &quot;test&quot;</code> to <code>palette = &quot;{xxx}&quot;</code> throughout, and reknit!</p>

<div id="but-valuable" class="section level3">
<h3>…but Valuable</h3>
<p>Despite the low barriers to entry, my hope is that there is a lot to learn with <code>Rtistic</code>. For example, participants might get exposure to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Package structure</strong>: By filling in the missing pieces of an existing package, teams will navigate through an R package file structure. Whether or not teams have package building aspirations, being able to read package source code is a useful skill.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> It’s also a chance to practice good documentation with commenting and vignette writing.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Collaboration on GitHub</strong>: I’m convicted no one will ever understand git or GitHub by <em>reading</em>. The easiest way to learn forks, branches, and pull requests is to use them. <code>Rtistic</code> attempts to make this as easy as possible. Multiple teams should never need to edit the same file, so the likelihood of a big merge conflict problem is low.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>ggplot2 styling</strong>: <code>ggplot2</code> is intuitive; however, compared to most of the <code>tidyverse</code>, it is intuitive in the sense of having a rich philosophical basis - not in the sense of “barely needed to read the docs because I can infer it all”. Unfortunately, this difference can make it feel <em>unintuitive</em> to new users. Exposure to <code>ggplot2</code> theme options pays dividends in getting the most from the package.</li>
<li><strong>HTML / CSS</strong>: R users more typically come from math and stats backgrounds (versus tech), knowledge of front-end web development can be limited. However, users of any of the <code>*down</code> packages<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> can benefit a lot by having even a cursory understanding of these tools to take advantage of RMarkdown’s customization capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this seems like too much at once, the modular nature of the project makes it easy to strip down. If GitHub is out of scope, participants can locally change a small number of files and share them with an organizer for compilation. If <code>ggplot2</code> and HTML/CSS are too much to tackle at once, either the plot or RMarkdown theme pieces can be ignored.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-level-playing-field" class="section level3">
<h3>A Level Playing Field</h3>
<p>For the more complex tasks of <code>ggplot2</code> and RMarkdown themes, the <code>scratchpad/</code> directory provides additional context. This directory contains two RMarkdown files with working examples of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emilyriederer/Rtistic/blob/master/scratchpad/rmd-theme-demo.Rmd"><strong>RMarkdown styling with CSS</strong></a> for participants to edit and re-knit. This can help build intuition over how RMarkdown is translated into different HTML tags and how those respond to CSS</li>
<li>As many <a href="https://github.com/emilyriederer/Rtistic/blob/master/scratchpad/gg-theme-demo.Rmd"><strong>ggplot2 theme options</strong></a> as I could possibly fit in one plot with the goal of exposing participants to all of the possible options</li>
</ul>
<p>The plot, in particular, is hopefully illuminating since the theme is in no way intended to be coherent. Each design choice uses wildly different fonts, colors, and alignments to make it very clear what line of code corresponds to each element:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-05-25-rtistic-a-package-by-numbers-repo.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Again, try this out on <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/project/363105">RStudio Cloud</a> by opening up the <code>scratchpad/gg-theme-demo.Rmd</code> and playing around.</p>
